# Calculator
Programmer: Peter Oo.

It is a `Simple GUI Calculator Program` written in `tkinter python`.

Complete python source file is uploaded, but we are here to learn the `basic mechanism`.

`Tkinter documents` provides useful resources starting from creating `windows form` to advanced.

In this simple GUI program, we have the following code parts....

```python
from tkinter import *
```
All the tkinter methods and classes can be imported using above code.
Creating a window for any widgets to be placed on it, the following codes are used,
```python
# Creating a windows form
win = Tk()
# infinite loop to display it until red cross button is hit.
# your statements
# your statements
# your statements!!!
win.mainloop()
```
The remaining statements belonged to windows form shall be coded inside the `win` object and its `mainloop`.
Basically, the calculator needs a display to show input mathematical expressions and output results. For that, Entry widgets are useful.
```python
# Creating an Entry display
txt = StringVar()                   # assigning txt as a buffer to store string data
display = Entry(win,
                textvariable=txt,   # works as a buffer to get data from entry or to set data to entry
                bg='white',         # background color
                fg='blue'           # foreground color
                font=('Arial', 12), # font style
                relief='groove',    # border style
                bd=5,               # border thickness
                justify='right',    # as normal calculator, we should set cursor at the right side the display
                width=30)
```
It's setting the required options for the display, but to show it on the windows, following code is added.
```python
display.pack()
```
We can use other methods like `.grid() or .place()`, too.

So, before we're not going any further, let's take a look back to winform base template.
We used simple template, but we would like to fix its **width and height**. For that, we can use the following methods..
```python
win.geometry('300x400+0+0') # the format is [width x height + 'x' coordinate + 'y' coordinate]
win.resizable(False, False)  # which make it unadjustable.
```
We can change **background color and menu title** using following statements
```python
win.title('Calculator')
win.config(bg='red')
```
So, it Looks like as below....

It is bloooooody.!

The next step, We are going to create the **buttons**....
```python
button_n = Button(frame,        # need to create a frame to layout buttons using .grid() methods
                  text='/',
                  font=('Arial', 12),
                  width=5,
                  height=2)
button_n.grid(row=0, column=0)
```
But, in the above codes, we need to create a frame to layout the buttons using `.grid()` methods properly, because `.grid()` methods cannot be mixed with `.pack()` methods in the same template.
We will have to go ahead and create a frame before the buttons are created. After that we will place the buttons on that master frame using `.grid()` methods.
```python
frame = Frame(win)    # on windows template
```
After that, We can create as many buttons as we want such as button_1,2,3,5,...,and so on by changing `row and column` to form a buttons layout.

So, the buttons layout should be like this....

Oops, numbers in my calculator are upside down. Anyway, it is great!

Then, when we hit the buttons, it should do something like printing data, or calling police station :joy::joy::joy:

We will need to add `command option` when we create the button widgets like....
```python
button_n = Button(frame,    
                  text='/',
                  font=('Arial', 12),
                  width=5,
                  height=2,
                  command=do_something)
button_n.grid(row=0, column=0)
```
So, when we hit the button, it will call `do_something` function. The functions can be defined outside `win` template and `win.mainloop()` like.....
```python
def do_something():
  txt.set('Hello world')
```
For now, I will call the function `do_something` when I hit `button C`. And It should display like this.....

It is crazy!!! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

Well, as a final step, it is time to compile the source code to get executable file. For that, we will use pyinstaller, and following command will be typed in the command prompt.

`pyinstaller --noconfirm --windowed --icon "D:\Python\...\logo.ico" "D:\Python\...\calculator.py"`

And, Done, we are ready to play our own calculator.

It is our final calculator design, so lovely....
